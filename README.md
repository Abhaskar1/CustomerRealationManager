# CustomerRealationManager
The app has been developed using Spring And Hibernate.
We have created a simple database application where we can add,update and delete users.
The app currently lacks form Validation.
The database use is MySQL with userid "springstudent" and password "springstudent".
The database name used for the project is "web_cutomer_tracker" and the table name is "customer".
We make use of a DAO implementation to interact with the database,but our main app interacts with the Service Layer which in turn interacts with DAO implmentation which ultimately interacts with the Database.

SCOPE OF DEVLOPMENT:
Addition of form validation feature
